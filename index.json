It’s a place where I can experiment with new technologies, test out virtual environments, and try out different configurations—without draining my wallet or disrupting the rest of the household. Here’s a breakdown of my current setup and how I’ve optimized it for efficiency and independence.\nThe primary goal of this setup is to create an isolated environment where everything can be tested without risk to the outside network. To achieve this, all traffic within the homelab is routed through a virtual instance of OpnSense.\nAccess to the lab is strictly controlled; I connect exclusively via RDP to a Linux jumphost. This ensures that the homelab remains fully isolated from external systems and networks.\nIn a future post, I will dive deeper into the configuration of OpnSense and the internal network setup.\nThe Hardware My lab is built around two Intel NUCs, each equipped with 64GB of RAM. These compact machines provide enough horsepower to run a variety of workloads, but they’re small enough to keep everything running quietly and with minimal energy consumption.\nBut the best part? The lab is completely independent from our home network, so if something breaks or if I’m running some resource-heavy workloads, Netflix and the rest of the household’s devices still work without interruption. It's the perfect balance between experimenting with new tech and maintaining a smooth home environment.\nRoom for Growth While my lab setup is functional for now, there’s always room for improvement. There’s still plenty of capacity for growth, and new hardware is always welcome—whether it's adding more storage, integrating additional virtual machines, or even expanding to more powerful components like additional NUCs or networking gear. But like with any hobby or project, everything in due time. I’m not in a rush to make the lab bigger or more complex; I’m more focused on optimizing what I have and gradually expanding as needed.\nWhy This Setup Works for Me This lab setup strikes the perfect balance between cost and functionality. The Intel NUCs are compact and efficient, and they’re flexible enough to run a variety of virtualized environments without creating too much overhead. Plus, the fact that the lab is completely isolated from the rest of the home network means that I can take risks, experiment, and tinker without worrying about affecting our daily activities.\nIn the future, I’m excited to keep building this lab. Whether it’s adding automation, testing cloud solutions, there’s always room to improve and learn. For now, though, I’m happy with this setup and looking forward to where it can take me next.\nI created a page where I track the current status of my homelab with network diagrams, pictures and BOMs.\nSetup\n","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/post/home-lab-setup/","section":"post","tags":["homelab"],"title":"Home Lab Setup"},{"body":"","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/tags/homelab/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Homelab"},{"body":"","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/tags/intelnuc/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Intelnuc"},{"body":"","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/post/","section":"post","tags":[""],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"Hardware Network BOM (Bill of Material) Component Specifications Intel NUC i5 2 x 32GB RAM, 1TB SATA SSD, 1TB NVMe SSD Intel NUC i7 2 x 32GB RAM, 1TB SATA SSD, 1TB NVMe SSD TP-Link Switch 5 Port, 1 Gbit Ethernet ","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/setup/","section":"","tags":["homelab","intelnuc"],"title":"Setup"},{"body":"","link":"https://ps-cloudlabs.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"Hey there! I’m Peter Summa, a Cloud Engineer at evoila, a tech-driven company based in Germany.\nWith a strong focus on virtualization and cloud technologies, I specialize in solutions like vSphere, NSX, Avi and Tanzu. Over the years, I’ve worked hands-on with everything from traditional VMware environments to modern cloud-native technologies like Terraform, Kubernetes, and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF).\nThis blog is a place where I share my experiences, insights, and the lessons learned while building homelab setups, optimizing cloud environments, and deploying complex virtualized infrastructures. Whether you're looking to automate your workflows with Terraform, explore Kubernetes in a hybrid cloud setup, or dive into the intricacies of VCF, there’s something here for you.\nWhen I’m not working on client projects or tinkering with my own homelab, I’m researching the latest trends in cloud engineering or finding ways to simplify complex technical problems.\nThanks for stopping by!
